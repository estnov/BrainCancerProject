# BrainCancerProject
This project will process the images from a restricted dataset (indicated below) and apply preprocessing using C++ OpenCV and machine learning models on Python.

Consideration:
The trained SVC model could not be included in the current project.

## Development
First the Python trained models were developed showing that the SVC gets amazing results detecting if it is or not a brain tummor. We must notice that the images were preprocessed applying a new combination of techniques. When the paper of them is published I will add the reference here. 

The app includes all this preprocessing, I have made it with Native C++ on Android Studio.
